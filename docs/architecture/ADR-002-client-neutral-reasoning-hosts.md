# ADR-002: Client-Neutral Reasoning Hosts

## Status

Proposed.

## Context

Erga's product core is the local evidence ledger, application state, résumé workflow, and MCP
server, with an optional Obsidian projection. Those capabilities should remain useful without
requiring one particular AI product or orchestration runtime.

The original automatic job-link path was optimized for Hermes, and the complete job workflow was
available only through the broad legacy `default` tool profile. That made a host integration look
like a product requirement and forced other MCP hosts to accept unrelated mail, monitor,
Git-research, and token-recording tools.

## Decision

Treat the connected MCP client as an optional reasoning host around a complete local Erga system:

- Erga never selects or calls an LLM.
- Erga never asks for or stores a model API credential.
- Model authentication, entitlements, limits, and token accounting belong to whichever MCP host
  the user chooses.
- A least-privilege `career` profile exposes the bounded job-intake and document workflow without
  bulk private-data export, full writing-sample/template context, mail, Hermes monitors, Git
  scanning, or token recording.
- The `career-private` profile is an explicit opt-in extension for hosts that may receive the full
  writing-style source material or package the user's private career archive.
- MCP initialization instructions carry portable job-link routing policy.
- No client brand is part of the core compatibility contract. Host-specific configuration,
  readiness checks, messaging channels, and convenience automation remain optional integrations.

## Consequences

- Users may operate Erga through its CLI alone or connect any compatible MCP host.
- Hermes remains a supported optional integration rather than a required runtime.
- Every host receives the same evidence and local-artifact semantics.
- Deterministic pre-model routing cannot be guaranteed on hosts without a hook equivalent to the
  Hermes router; MCP instructions and tool descriptions provide the portable fallback.
- Optional host adapters or Obsidian projections may be added without changing Erga's evidence,
  résumé, or application model.
