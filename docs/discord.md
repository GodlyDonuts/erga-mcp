# Optional Discord bridge

The Discord bridge is a power-up around Erga's complete local system. It is not part of the core
installation contract: résumé knowledge, private application state, CLI commands, and the MCP
server remain usable when Discord is absent, stopped, misconfigured, or deleted. Any optional
Obsidian projection is independent of Discord as well.

## Install and configure

Install the bridge's isolated dependency:

```bash
uv sync --extra discord
```

Create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), enable
Message Content Intent, and invite it with only:

- View Channels
- Send Messages
- Read Message History

Then run:

```bash
uv run erga discord configure \
  --config ~/.config/erga-mcp/config.toml \
  --project-dir /absolute/path/to/project
```

The wizard asks which local coding CLI should execute unattended Discord turns. Presets cover
Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenCode V2, Gemini CLI, Cursor Agent, and GitHub Copilot CLI. The
advanced custom option accepts an executable and a JSON argument array, runs it without a shell,
and requires a `{prompt}` placeholder. `{project_dir}` and `{output_path}` are also available.

This backend selection belongs only to Discord. You can use no other coding assistant, connect
several through `erga connect`, or replace the Discord backend later.

## Login and credentials

The optional readiness check runs one minimal headless turn using the coding tool's existing local
login. Erga removes common model API-key variables for preset subscription-backed clients so the
check and later bridge turns cannot silently fall back to an ambient API key.

The Discord bot token is hidden during entry and stored in the operating-system credential store.
It never appears in Erga's TOML configuration, `discord-bridge.json`, process arguments, or project
MCP files.

Discord now uses unique usernames without four-digit discriminators. Enter a username such as
`emperor_sai`, a stable numeric user ID, or comma-separated values for several trusted people.
`name#1234` is rejected because it is no longer the current identity format. Numeric IDs remain the
more stable authorization choice if a user might rename their account.

## Run and manage

Test in the foreground first:

```bash
uv run erga discord run --config ~/.config/erga-mcp/config.toml
```

Then use the optional background lifecycle:

```bash
uv run erga discord start --config ~/.config/erga-mcp/config.toml
uv run erga discord status --config ~/.config/erga-mcp/config.toml
uv run erga discord stop --config ~/.config/erga-mcp/config.toml
```

Direct messages from trusted users are accepted. Server messages require an explicit bot mention
unless the owner knowingly disables that safeguard during configuration. Bot-authored messages
are always ignored, only one backend turn runs at a time, incoming content is bounded, and long
responses are split below Discord's message limit.

Private runtime settings live beside Erga's private config. Logs and the nonce-bearing background
process record live in Erga's owner-only data directory.

## Failure boundaries

A missing Discord package, bot token, coding CLI, login, or process affects only the bridge. Every
related error states that the local core remains ready. Re-running `erga discord configure` safely
replaces the optional settings and credential; it does not re-import résumé knowledge or rewrite
an optional Obsidian workspace.

The bridge may prepare local research, records, and résumé proposals through Erga. It never grants
authority to submit an application, send employer messages, approve invented evidence, or mutate
remote mail.
